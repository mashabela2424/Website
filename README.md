Part 2 – Improvements from Lecturer Feedback In response to the feedback received, I made visual and 
structural enhancements to improve consistency and user experience. Specifically, I updated the colour 
scheme of the service and help blocks to better align with the overall design of the website. Additionally, 
I centred all headings across my classes to create a more balanced and visually appealing layout. 



Part 3 – New Additions For Part 3, I focused on implementing interactive elements, dynamic content, 
and on-page SEO features: 

• Interactive Elements: I added a lightbox gallery with slideshow controls to enhance image 
viewing, and a modal for trainer profiles that dynamically displays content. These features 
improve user engagement and interactivity, which is a key principle in modern web design (MDN 
Web Docs, 2023). 

• Dynamic Content: I implemented JavaScript-based filtering and sorting for products, allowing 
users to search by category and sort by name or price. This makes browsing more intuitive and 
responsive, especially for users navigating large product lists. 

• Form Enhancements: Both the enquiry and contact forms now include dropdowns for message 
type, client-side validation, and structured input fields. These forms are tailored to their specific 
purposes and provide feedback upon submission, improving usability and accessibility.

• On-Page SEO: I added meta tags (title, description, keywords), Open Graph and Twitter card tags 
for social sharing, canonical URLs, and schema markup (Organization, Product, Service, 
ContactPage, and LocalBusiness). Schema markup helps search engines understand the content 
more accurately and can lead to rich results in search listings (Schema App, 2023). 

• Accessibility and Structure: I included ARIA labels for navigation, forms, and modals, improved 
alt text for images, and used semantic HTML elements to enhance accessibility and SEO. 
Structuring content with proper heading tags and semantic elements also supports screen 
readers and improves mobile usability (Backlinko, 2025). 

These additions collectively elevate the professionalism, usability, and discoverability of the Lift Kings 
website.
